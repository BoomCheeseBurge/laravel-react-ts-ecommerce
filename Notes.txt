----------------------------------------------------------------

Installed DaisyUI using NPM.

Replaced Tailwind 'forms' plugin with DaisyUI plugin in the Tailwind config file.
Also, removed TailwindCSS forms using the following command:

    npm uninstall @tailwindcss/forms

Added DaisyUI class attributes for text input, text label, and checkbox input components.

Added DaisyUI class attributes for primary, secondary, and danger button components.

Added DaisyUI class attributes for Link class attributes in login and register page.

______________

Modified the login page to have a link to the register page.

______________

Changed the authenticated layout component's function name from 'Authenticated' to 'AuthenticatedLayout' to ease auto-completion.

______________

The navigation between pages may be slow due to SSR (Server-Side Rendering) approach.

Moreover, the SSR server is NOT running yet, so that is also a factor causing the project to be slow in development.

----------------------------------------------------------------

Moved the default nav element and its content to a scratchpad html file.

______________

Added DaisyUI's navbar style to the newly created NavBar component.

______________

Modified the 'Welcome' page by removing the previous default content.

Added authenticated layout component to the page.

Added DaisyUI's hero section to the 'Welcome' page.

______________

Hide cart and profile dropdowns for un-authenticated user by using Inertia's auth prop.

----------------------------------------------------------------

Installed Spatie Laravel Permission package.

Added the trait related to the package unto the 'User' model.

Created enum files for 'Role' and 'Permission'.

______________

Created seeder files for 'Role' and 'User'.

______________

The established roles and permissions are as follows:

    Users have roles -> roles have permissions -> users inherit permissions from roles

----------------------------------------------------------------

Installed Filament but using the following command:

    composer require filament/filament

The command excludes the specified version to avoid conflicts that arises when including it.

The command following afterwards is as follows:

    php artisan filament:install --panels

Just press enter on the ID.

Filament user creation user is skipped because the seeder already generates the necessary users.

______________

Added permission and role aliases in the 'app.php' bootstrap file.
Due to this registered aliases, the Filament's default admin login page is no longer accessible as it will forcibly access the admin panel instead of the login page.
Instead, a redirect will be made to the app's login page.

Added Spatie's role middleware to the 'AdminPanelProvider.php' file as well as 'auth' middleware, so that the admin panel can only be accessed by authenticated users.

______________

Modified the 'store' method of the 'AuthenticatedSessionController.php' file to redirect admin and vendor users to their admin panel, while common users to the welcome page. 

______________

If the user login went bogus, that just means the app is still trying to force a redirect to admin panel.

Just hard reload the webpage and the user login should be successful.

______________

Filament's authentication middleware is commented out to use the project's authentication.
