The navigation between pages may be slow due to SSR (Server-Side Rendering) approach.

The command excludes the specified version to avoid conflicts that arises when including it.

The command following afterwards is as follows:

Just press enter on the ID.

Filament user creation user is skipped because the seeder already generates the necessary users.

______________

Added permission and role aliases in the 'app.php' bootstrap file.
Due to this registered aliases, the Filament's default admin login page is no longer accessible as it will forcibly access the admin panel instead of the login page.
Instead, a redirect will be made to the app's login page.

Added Spatie's role middleware to the 'AdminPanelProvider.php' file as well as 'auth' middleware, so that the admin panel can only be accessed by authenticated users.

______________

Modified the 'store' method of the 'AuthenticatedSessionController.php' file to redirect admin and vendor users to their admin panel, while common users to the welcome page. 

______________

If the user login went bogus, that just means the app is still trying to force a redirect to admin panel.

Just hard reload the webpage and the user login should be successful.

______________

Filament's authentication middleware is commented out to use the project's authentication.
