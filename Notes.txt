______________

Modified the login page to have a link to the register page.

______________

Changed the authenticated layout component's function name from 'Authenticated' to 'AuthenticatedLayout' to ease auto-completion.

______________

The navigation between pages may be slow due to SSR (Server-Side Rendering) approach.

Moreover, the SSR server is NOT running yet, so that is also a factor causing the project to be slow in development.

----------------------------------------------------------------

______________

Created seeder files for 'Role' and 'User'.

______________

The established roles and permissions are as follows:

    Users have roles -> roles have permissions -> users inherit permissions from roles

----------------------------------------------------------------

Installed Filament but using the following command:

    composer require filament/filament

The command excludes the specified version to avoid conflicts that arises when including it.

The command following afterwards is as follows:

    php artisan filament:install --panels

Just press enter on the ID.

Filament user creation user is skipped because the seeder already generates the necessary users.

______________

Added permission and role aliases in the 'app.php' bootstrap file.
Due to this registered aliases, the Filament's default admin login page is no longer accessible as it will forcibly access the admin panel instead of the login page.
Instead, a redirect will be made to the app's login page.

Added Spatie's role middleware to the 'AdminPanelProvider.php' file as well as 'auth' middleware, so that the admin panel can only be accessed by authenticated users.

______________

Modified the 'store' method of the 'AuthenticatedSessionController.php' file to redirect admin and vendor users to their admin panel, while common users to the welcome page. 

______________

If the user login went bogus, that just means the app is still trying to force a redirect to admin panel.

Just hard reload the webpage and the user login should be successful.

______________

Filament's authentication middleware is commented out to use the project's authentication.

----------------------------------------------------------------

Created model and migration for 'Department'.

______________

Unguard all the models associated with Filament's admin panel through the 'AdminPanelProvider.php' file.

This is a safe and common practice since Filament saves model data safely.

______________

Generated Filament resource for 'Department'.

Added Filament inputs to the form.

'onBlur' will only send network requests with property updates when a user clicks away from an input, or presses the tab key to move to the next input.

Added Filament columns to the table.

And, registered the relation in `DepartmentResource::getRelations()` method.
______________

Added 'parent' belongs to relation in the 'Category' model.

______________

Created seeder for 'Department' and 'Category' models.

----------------------------------------------------------------

Created model, migration, and controller for 'Product'.

Created enum file for 'ProductStatusEnum'.

Created Filament resource for 'Product'.

______________

Added belongs to relationship of 'Department' and 'Category' to the 'Product' model.

Added inputs to the form of Product resource.

    php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Spatie\MediaLibrary\MediaLibraryServiceProvider" --tag="medialibrary-migrations"

______________

Added sub-navigation for the Product resource, so that later after product images section has been established, users can switch between the two sections (edit and images).

Copied and modified the 'EditProduct.php' file for the Product images.

Modified the 'Product' model to be able to work with Spatie media library.

______________

Registered media conversions from Spatie media library to the Product model.

______________

Override the hero icon for the product images and product resource navigation using Blade UI kit hero icon.

______________

As of 10/02/2025, the image conversion using Spatie media library does NOT work.
The error came from the Laravel queue listener/worker not being able to perform the conversion.

----------------------------------------------------------------

Created model for 'VariationType' and 'VariationTypeOption'.

Created model and migration for 'ProductVariation'.

______________

The migration tables defined in the product variations table can be visualized as follows:

o Size [variation type]
    |
    |----> Small [variation type option]
    |
    |----> Medium [variation type option]
    |
    |----> Large [variation type option]

o Color [variation type]
    |
    |----> Red [variation type option]
    |
    |----> Green [variation type option]
    |
    |----> Blue [variation type option]

Both variation types creates various combinations of size and color options.

e.g.,

    Small - Red
    Small - Green
    Small - Blue
    Medium - Red
    Medium - Green
    Medium - Blue
    Large - Red
    Large - Green
    Large - Blue

Then, there are also the quantity and price associated with each of those combinations.

==================================================
    Combination        |    Quantity    | Price |
==================================================
    Small - Red        |        10      |   10  |
    Small - Green      |        1       |   99  |
    Small - Blue       |        15      |   85  |
    Medium - Red       |        30      |   13  |
    Medium - Green     |        24      |   10  |
    Medium - Blue      |        12      |   20  |
    Large - Red        |        4       |   10  |
    Large - Green      |        100     |   31  |
    Large - Blue       |        67      |   10  |


Say that the first three variation type options have the following IDs:

================================
    ID  |   VariationTypeOption
================================
    1   |    Small
    2   |    Medium
    3   |    Large
    4   |    Red
    5   |    Green
    6   |    Blue

Then, in the 'product variations' table, the table should something as follows:

=============================================================================
    ID  |   Product ID  |   Quantity    | Price |   [Variation type options]
=============================================================================
    1   |       1       |       10      |   15  |           [1, 4]          |
    2   |       1       |       12      |   15  |           [1, 5]          |

Where '1' refers to 'Small' variation type option, and '4' refers to 'Red' variation type option.
The product ID shows that they belong to the same product from the same vendor.

______________

Quantity can be set null which informs that the quantity of the said product is infinite.

Price is also nullable which if not specified, the price will be taken from the default price of the product.

______________

Created enum file for product variation types.

______________

Dynamic variation type options are implemented using Filament's repeater feature.

Added 'hasMany' relation to the variation type model from the product model. 

Timestamps for 'VariationType' and 'VariationTypeOption' model has been disabled.

______________

Override the title for 'product variation types' and 'product variation type options' page.

----------------------------------------------------------------

Reduced the sidebar width in 'AdminPanelProvider.php' file.

Copied 'ProductVariationTypes.php' file to be 'ProductVariations.php' file.

______________

The combination of variation type options is known as Cartesian Product.

______________

Added 'hasMany' relation from Product to ProductVariation.

______________

In the 'ProductVariations.php' file, there is cartesian merge (user-defined) method in which its purpose can be depicted as follows:

================================
   [Variation type options]    |
================================
        Small - Red            |
        Small - Green          |
        Small - Blue           |
        Medium - Red           |
        Medium - Red           |
        Medium - Red           |
        Large - Red            |
        Large - Green          |
        Large - Blue           |

Say that the small, medium, large were previously created and have their own quantity and price.

The vendor decides to add another size variant, 'XL'.

In that case, the variations query to array will generate the following:

================================
   [Variation type options]    |
================================
        Small - Red            |
        Small - Green          |
        Small - Blue           |
        Medium - Red           |
        Medium - Red           |
        Medium - Red           |
        Large - Red            |
        Large - Green          |
        Large - Blue           |
        XL - Red               |
        XL - Green             |
        XL - Blue              |

It is known that there are associated quantity and price for small, medium, and large, except XL.

The merge cartesian method will provide default quantity and price for XL.

=========================================================
   [Variation type options]    |   Quantity    | Price |
=========================================================
        Small - Red            |       10      |   15  |
        Small - Green          |       10      |   15  |
        Small - Blue           |       10      |   15  |
        Medium - Red           |       10      |   15  |
        Medium - Red           |       10      |   15  |
        Medium - Red           |       10      |   15  |
        Large - Red            |       10      |   15  |
        Large - Green          |       10      |   15  |
        Large - Blue           |       10      |   15  |
        XL - Red               |       10      |   15  |
        XL - Green             |       10      |   15  |
        XL - Blue              |       10      |   15  |

______________

The cartesian product method will generate the following data:

==============================================================================
   [Variation type options]    |    Default Quantity    |   Default Price   |
==============================================================================
        [Small, Red]            |    product-default     |  product-default  |
        [Small, Green]          |    product-default     |  product-default  |
        [Small, Blue]           |    product-default     |  product-default  |
        [Medium, Red]           |    product-default     |  product-default  |
        [Medium, Red]           |    product-default     |  product-default  |
        [Medium, Red]           |    product-default     |  product-default  |
        [Large, Red]            |    product-default     |  product-default  |
        [Large, Green]          |    product-default     |  product-default  |
        [Large, Blue]           |    product-default     |  product-default  |
        [XL, Red]               |    product-default     |  product-default  |
        [XL, Green]             |    product-default     |  product-default  |
        [XL, Blue]              |    product-default     |  product-default  |

The generated JSON data from cartesianProduct() looks somewhat as follows:

[
    {
        "variation_type_1": {
            "id": 1,
            "name": "Black",
            "type": "Color",
        },
        "variation_type_2": {
            "id": 4,
            "name": "Small",
            "type": "size",
        },
        "quantity": 10,
        "price": 15
    },
    {},
    {},
    {},
    {},
    {},
    {},
    {},
    {},
]

Previously, the cartesianProduct output uses the product's default value of quantity and price.
However, some combinations already have their own defined values for quantity and price.
This is where the mergeResult() function appends those existing values.

______________

Set data before form fill, before save, and record update for product variations section.

Added cast field for 'variation_type_option_ids' attribute on ProductVariation model to 'json' datatype.

----------------------------------------------------------------

Modified the 'success' session data in the 'HandleInertiaRequests' file as well as its type in the 'index.d.ts. file.

Setup success message in the 'AuthenticatedLayout' component.

NOTE:

    If you don't plan on having any interactive features that require canceling individual timeouts (like a close button) 
    or any feature that requires clearing all timeouts, and you're solely relying on the useEffect cleanup for unmounting/re-rendering cleanup 
    and the setTimeout callback for cleanup after 5 seconds, then you don't strictly need timeoutRefs in your current code.

    useEffect Cleanup: The useEffect cleanup function already handles canceling the timeout when the component unmounts or pageProps.success changes.

Observation:

    There is a weird occurrence where after the success message pops up and then hides again, try saving the success message component file.
    The success message with the same message will show up again and then hides.
    A possible reasoning is due to React's Strict mode.
